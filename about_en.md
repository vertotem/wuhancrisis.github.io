## Background

People are facing death in Wuhan. They are screaming for right of life. 

People desperately broad their SOS message on SNS for the very last change.

## Source

Started from Feb 3rd, Weibo (doubtably the largest sns in China) opened up [Virus Patient SOS](https://huati.weibo.com/6882551) hashtag (yes, that needs platform authentication first), thousands of SOS messages flocked in from individuals trapped in Wuhan and other Hubei cities. 

This website uses crawler to collect and archive those messages published in Weibo platform.

## Site

There is an index page and this about page. The index page is infinite scrollable, with google translate widget.

Messages are shown chronically, with small batch randomization, for presenting more of them. Select date on top left.

Click the title to the original post on the platform, if exists.

## Misson

The website wish to inform more people about this on-going crisis, happening on individuals just like you and me. Grief and desperation overwhelmed short messages sent from them.

__They do not deserve that. And all of us, are not innocent.__

# ! ! Platform Censorship ! !

Based on Weibo manager (if not CEO), only 20% of messages posted in the hashtag went public. Around a hundred delete per day is estimated based on crawling log.

Plus, the platform __regulates__ exposures of user's posts: the published posts are not deleted and exists on the posters' homepage, but it will not be included in other's timelines, including the hashtag channel. This means even people posted their SOS messages with SOS hashtag, their SOS will not appear in the SOS channel, or even their friends' timeline. 

Account shown below is a [local volunteer group](https://weibo.com/u/7384348835) that coordinates between untreated patients and hospitals. The account is also regulated, and even suspended for a short period.

On the other hand, with minimal attempt on the approach to search for posters of SOS messages and then crawl their posts, the number of valid SOS posts during the same time period exploded by __nearly 5 times__, from [7 to 32 SOS messages](/weibo_censor.txt).

The screening process keeps secret, so it could be really filter out invalid message.  Besides Weibo, [People's Daily](https://activity.peopleapp.com/qiuzhutongdao/), [China Central Television](http://itv.cctv.com/form/index/column/cctv_news/config/21120/iid/121795)and other party media also sets up SOS reporting channel, however none of recieved or followup is disclosed.

Embarrassingly, the number of SOS messages collected by this site is __way way less than the actual magnitude__, due to factors like user demographics, local limitations, collecting methods, and censorship. Best effort is given to try for any insignificant help I can make.

## Data Usage

As of now, the website keenly hopes to call for humanitarian help and respect to each and every individuals in this crisis. They are way way more than a statistical number.

Later, may be the Spring coming, every detail of those messages shall be roar out loadly yet reviewed carefully, for the remember, as for the future.
